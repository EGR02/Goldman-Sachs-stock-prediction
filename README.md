DO NOT USE THESE MODELS FOR MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISON*** UNLESS YOU LIKE LOSING MONEY***
You will find two files, a report and the three models in one unique ipynb file: 
    - Report.pdf. Some conclusions about the dropout could be wrong. I will devolop other models to see other models to see if a drop out could be useful. 
    - Project.iypnb. There you will find: a LSTM model that takes into account two features, a LSTM with one single feature and the LSTM 7 dense for predicting
                      the next seven prices.
