DO NOT USE THESE MODELS FOR MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISON UNLESS YOU LIKE LOSING MONEY
############################################################################################
You will find two files, a report and the three models in one unique ipynb file: 
    - Report.pdf. Some conclusions about the dropout could be wrong, but theoretically, given the assumption that we are using, it should not be a mistake. I will devolop other models to see if a drop out could be useful. 
    - Project.iypnb. There you will find: a LSTM model that takes into account two features, a LSTM with one single feature and the LSTM 7 dense for predicting
                      the next seven prices.

N.B. I'll upload the models seperately, I'll show the predictions for the test set, as well. I can alreay tell you that the predictions for the test set are worse than the valid set (look at the models, and you will find an answer).
